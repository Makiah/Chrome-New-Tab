# Makiah's Chrome New Tab

![Screenshot](/doc/Screenshot.png "Screenshot")

The whole point of a New Tab page is to get you to the page you want to see as fast as it possibly can, without cluttering your browser's tabs.  

Built on Angular, this Chrome add-on has the following: 
1. A predictive search field field.  This should determine the page you want to see before you finish typing it, and navigate automatically to that page once it's reasonably sure that's what you want.  Although rudimentary (currently, it just checks whether you've typed something like 'gma' and redirects to Gmail), it works.  
2. A quick navigation menu, for links that you want to be able to click on right away (without having to type anything in).  
3. An auto-close if unused for 5 seconds.
